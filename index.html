  <h2> My experience</h2>
  <p>My web development experience is growing. I Started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript on my own at the end of 2020. I studied it for close to a year on my own before deciding going to college would benefit me greatly in learning web development. In college I learned about software development concepts. I also went deeper into HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I picked up several new programming languages as well. I took a course on Python and really enjoyed learning to write programs in python.  </p>

  <h2>Learning goals</h2>
  <p>In this course I hope to gain a better understanding of git/GitHub version control. I am excited to see Bootstrap and jQuery in the course as well. Bootstrap seems like it will be a great addition to my knowledge and will be helpful in building beautiful websites. Canva looks to be a great for developing icons and other things so that is also something I look forward to learning. </p>

  <h2>Outcomes</h2>
  <p>With the knowledge gained in this course I intend to up my design skills and build much better websites. Using jQuery to build interactive websites looks to be a great way to bring interaction to websites and truly bring them to life. Most importantly though I'm excited that learning GitHub will help me become more marketable in the front-end web development industry where I intend to find a job once done with college. This skill will help me collaborate with others and build beautiful websites that one person would have a hard time creating on their own. </p>
